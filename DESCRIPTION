Description: Midi files (a standard way to represent music as file) 
    are binary files and cannot be handled easily in R. 
    This package has functions to convert midi to csv,
    which can be read into R and transformed. The transformed csv files
    then can be saved as midi files. The package builds on
    C source code available at Fourmilab (https://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/)
    written by John Walker. This web site also has the documentation of the
    csv file format used.
